# CST 438 Project 02: API Template

Starter repo for Project 02. **One person per team** clicks **Use this template → Create a new
repository**, names it after your API, and adds teammates as collaborators.

> Replace this README with your own in Sprint 4. The prompt lists what it must contain.

## What's in here

| Path | What it is | When |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/proposal.md` | Proposal template: pitch, resources, ER sketch, endpoints, choices, risks | **Thu 10/1** |
| `docs/openapi.yaml` | A complete example contract (workout tracker). Replace it with your API. | Sprint 1 |
| `redocly.yaml` | Lint rules for the contract | Sprint 1 |
| `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/user_story.md` | Every new issue starts as a user story with acceptance criteria | now |
| `.github/pull_request_template.md` | Every PR starts with `Closes #` and a test checklist | now |
| `.gitignore` | Gradle, Android, IntelliJ, Node, and **secrets** (`.env`, keystores, `local.properties`) | now |

Where your code goes is up to you: an `api/` and an `android/` folder in this repo (monorepo),
or a second repo for the Android app. Write it down in an ADR.

## First 15 minutes

- [ ] Add teammates: **Settings → Collaborators**
- [ ] Protect `main`: **Settings → Rules → Rulesets → New branch ruleset**. Target the default branch,
      require a PR with **2 approvals** (1 for a team of 3), block force pushes. Enforcement: **Active**.
- [ ] Create milestones `Sprint 1` through `Sprint 4`: **Issues → Milestones**
- [ ] Create a Project board (Kanban) and link it: **Projects tab → Link a project**
- [ ] Start `docs/proposal.md` on a branch:

```bash
git switch -c docs/proposal
# edit docs/proposal.md
git add docs/proposal.md
git commit -m "Draft proposal"
git push -u origin docs/proposal
gh pr create --fill
```

## Working with the contract

No installs needed beyond Node (`npx` runs the tools).

```bash
# Lint: fix every error before you open a PR
npx @redocly/cli lint docs/openapi.yaml

# Mock server: a fake API built from the contract, at http://127.0.0.1:4010
npx @stoplight/prism-cli mock docs/openapi.yaml

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer x" "http://127.0.0.1:4010/api/v1/workouts?page=0&size=20"
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:4010/api/v1/workouts          # 401: no token
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer x" -H "Prefer: code=404" \
     http://127.0.0.1:4010/api/v1/workouts/42          # force an error response
```

The mock **validates** your requests and returns the `example:` values from the contract.
**Nothing is saved**: a POST followed by a GET returns the example, not what you posted. The
Android emulator reaches it at `http://10.0.2.2:4010`.

To see the contract rendered, paste `docs/openapi.yaml` into https://editor.swagger.io.
